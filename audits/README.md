| H1  | Incorrect memory offset parsing in PotatoLib getSettings function  | ✅ Fixed                             | Fixed in commit `00c7944`. The encoding was changed to an abi-encoded tuple of `(uint256,uint256,uint256)`, removing the need to use low-level assembly to decode the settings.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| H2  | Sybil Attack Amplification Through Flash Loan Balance Bypass       | ☑️ Acknowledged                      | Documented in the repository and the dApp for users. Setting minimum number of required followers will also help in mitigating this issue. Furthermore, there is no ways to perform flash loans on LUKSO Mainnet since there is currently no lending protocols on LUKSO Mainnet.                                                                                    |
| M1  | Follower Count Manipulation Through Sybil Networks                 | ☑️ Acknowledged                      | Documented in the repository and the dApp for users that the lower the eligibility criterias settings, the more likely they can be subject to bot farming. A v2 version of the Potato Tipper contract could implement oracles to check the age of the new follower. There is currently no way to mitigate that fully on-chain. Considered as acceptable for an MVP. |
| M2  | Permanent Tip Marking Despite Transfer Failure                     | ✅ Fixed                             | Fixed in commit `92325a0`. A change was added in the code to revert the user marked as tipped if the token transfer failed. Additional Foundry test was added.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| M3  | Front-running Vulnerability in Follow/Tip Mechanism                | ❌ False Positive                    | Seems to be a false positive. An MEV bot cannot front-run the transaction, as the follower making the follow is the one only eligible for a tip. Only issue that this could cause is to delay the follow transaction to be validated, and therefore make the follower wait longer to receive a tip.                                                                 |
| M4  | Griefing Attack via Unfollow Manipulation                          | 🔍 To investigate                    | Need further tests and investigations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| M5  | Assembly Memory Read Overflow in Settings Parser                   | ✅ Fixed (but was ❌ False positive) | Fixed with the fix implemented for H1. However, the offset suggested in the finding seems incorrect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| M6  | Cascading Failure Through Immutable External Contract Dependencies | ☑️ Acknowledged                      | LSP26 and the Potato token contract are not upgradable and cannot be changed. If these contracts have bugs or stop functioning, users can disconnect the `PotatoTipper` contract from their Universal Profile, remove the settings and remove the allowance of the PotatoTipper contract by interacting with the Potato token contract.                             |
| L1  | Zero Tip Amount Not Validated                                      | ✅ Fixed                             | Fixed in commit `92325a0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| W1  | Missing bounds checking in PotatoLib assembly memory access        | ✅ Fixed                             | Fixed with the fix implemented for H1 and commit `14e88b7` that refactored the codebase with the new free functions in `PotatoTipperSettingsLib.sol`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
